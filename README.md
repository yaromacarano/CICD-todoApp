# CI/CD Todo App

This repository contains a Java Spring Boot Todo application and the automation required to provision, configure, build, test, and deploy it on AWS.

Terraform manages the infrastructure, Ansible configures the EC2 hosts, and Jenkins carries the application from source code to a running ECS Fargate service. Docker, SonarQube, AWS ECR, an Application Load Balancer, and CloudWatch complete the delivery path.

## Architecture

The project has three automation layers:

1. **Terraform** creates the AWS infrastructure.
2. **Ansible** configures Jenkins Controller, Jenkins Agent, and SonarQube.
3. **Jenkins** builds, checks, packages, and deploys the application.

Application delivery flow:

```text
GitHub → Jenkins Controller → Jenkins Agent → Maven → Checkstyle → SonarQube → Docker → AWS ECR → AWS ECS Fargate → Application Load Balancer
```

The Jenkins pipeline performs these steps:

1. Verifies the required tools on the Jenkins Agent.
2. Fetches the source code from GitHub.
3. Runs Maven verification.
4. Runs Checkstyle analysis.
5. Sends code analysis to SonarQube.
6. Waits for the SonarQube Quality Gate.
7. Packages the Spring Boot application.
8. Builds a Docker image.
9. Pushes the image to AWS ECR.
10. Registers a new ECS task definition revision.
11. Updates the ECS service and waits until it becomes stable.

## Jenkins agent-based execution

The pipeline runs on a dedicated Jenkins Agent with the label `docker-aws-maven`.

The Jenkins Controller manages jobs and coordinates the pipeline. The Jenkins Agent performs the actual CI/CD work:

- Maven build and tests;
- Checkstyle and SonarQube analysis;
- Docker image build and push to ECR;
- ECS task definition registration and service deployment.

This keeps build tools and Docker operations away from the Jenkins Controller.

## Repository structure

- `src/` — Spring Boot application source code and tests.
- `data/` — keeps the local application data directory in Git through `.gitkeep`.
- `Dockerfile` — Docker image definition.
- `.dockerignore` — limits the Docker build context to the Dockerfile and application JAR.
- `Jenkinsfile` — Jenkins CI/CD pipeline.
- `pom.xml` — Maven project configuration.
- `aws/` — AWS deployment templates.
- `aws/task-definition-template.json` — ECS task definition template used by Jenkins.
- `scripts/deploy-ecs.sh` — registers a new task definition revision and updates the ECS service.
- `terraform/` — Terraform configuration for the AWS infrastructure.
- `ansible/` — Ansible inventory, variables, and playbooks for EC2 configuration.
- `docs/` — project documentation.
- `docs/screenshots/` — screenshots from documented releases and successful deployments.

## Run locally

Prerequisites:

- Java 21;
- Maven 3.9 or newer;
- Git.

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yaromacarano/CICD-todoApp.git
cd CICD-todoApp
```

Run Maven verification:

```bash
mvn clean verify
```

Start the application:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:8080
```

The application expects the `data/` directory in the project root. The repository keeps this directory through `data/.gitkeep`.

More details are available in `docs/02-local-run.md`.

## Run with Docker

Build the application artifact:

```bash
mvn clean package -DskipTests
```

Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t todo-app:v1.0 .
```

Run the container:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 todo-app:v1.0
```

More details are available in `docs/03-docker.md`.

## Deploy the complete environment

The complete deployment sequence is documented in `docs/07-terraform-ansible.md`.

In short:

1. Run Terraform locally to create the AWS resources.
2. Use the Ansible Controller to configure the EC2 servers.
3. Finish the Jenkins, SonarQube, and credentials configuration.
4. Start the Jenkins Pipeline manually with **Build Now**.

The current version does not configure an automatic GitHub webhook trigger.

## Project screenshots

Screenshots are grouped by project version inside `docs/screenshots/`.

The repository currently includes screenshots for:

- `v1.0-devops-foundation`;
- `v1.1-ecs-task-revision-deployment`;
- `v1.3-terraform-ansible-integration`.

## Documentation

- `docs/01-project-overview.md` — project purpose, architecture, and workflow.
- `docs/02-local-run.md` — local build and run instructions.
- `docs/03-docker.md` — Docker image build and container run instructions.
- `docs/04-jenkins-pipeline.md` — Jenkins tools, plugins, integrations, credentials, and pipeline stages.
- `docs/05-aws-ecr-ecs.md` — AWS architecture, IAM permissions, ECR, ECS, and ALB deployment details.
- `docs/06-troubleshooting.md` — common Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, SonarQube, Docker, ECR, and ECS issues.
- `docs/07-terraform-ansible.md` — complete infrastructure and configuration instructions.

## Data persistence

The application stores SQLite data inside the container at `/app/data/TodoList.db`. The current ECS task definition does not attach persistent storage, so replacing a task also replaces its database.

Keep `ecs_desired_count = 1` with this design. Running multiple tasks would create a separate SQLite database for each task.

## Security

Secrets are not stored in this repository. AWS access keys, the EC2 private key, SonarQube tokens, and passwords must be managed outside Git through Jenkins Credentials, AWS IAM, and local protected files.

Before committing screenshots, make sure that they do not expose access keys, tokens, passwords, private keys, or other sensitive information.
